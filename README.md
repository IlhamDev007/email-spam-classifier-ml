# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based email spam classifier that distinguishes between spam and legitimate (ham) emails. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classification, and is deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classifies emails as spam or ham
- Trained on a large labeled dataset
- Achieves 97% test accuracy and 98% training accuracy
- Real-time prediction with a user-friendly Streamlit interface

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit (for deployment)
